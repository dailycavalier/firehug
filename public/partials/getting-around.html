            <h3>How to have a great Summit in five easy steps</h3>
            <section class="description" ng-class="{ active : showingTip(0) }">
              <h4>Participate</h4>
              <p>The work of changing the world — the big, juicy Mozilla work — can
                happen only through active participation. Commit to pushing hard to go
                beyond what’s easy: embrace a new idea, ask a dumb question, lead a
                session, close your laptop. If a session does not move you, find
                another that does (it’s okay to shift). You alone get to decide what
                interests you, stretches you and ultimately helps you grow.</p>
              <h4>Make Room</h4>
              <p>Summit participants speak more than 114 languages. We don't all
                understand English fluently. Some of us are hard of hearing and
                visually impaired. When speaking, do it slowly and clearly. Check in
                with others as you go to make sure they understand.</p>
              <p>Some of us have physical limitations that make getting around
                difficult. Offer open structures with the idea of universal access,
                rather than waiting for special requests.  Provide clear information
                on access.</p>
              <p>Make room (literally and metaphorically) for all before anyone has to
                ask. Seek to understand, then to be understood. Practice empathy. Assume
                positive intent.</p>
              <h4>Practice Respect</h4>
              <p>The Summit is a space where you can safely be your true self (why would
                you be anything else?) and a time to respect others’ true selves as well
                (even if it bothers you from time to time). Respect their space and
                freedom and uniqueness, as much as our own.</p>
              <p>Take care of yourself, body and mind. We only have three days together
                and they will be long. Mozilla needs you at your best. Rest, eat, drink
                water, laugh a lot.</p>
              <p>Take care of the space and each other. Pick up trash. Share your power cord.</p>
              <h4>Be Helpful</h4>
              <p>If you see a problem, try to help. If you can’t help, help find someone who
                can. Don’t quietly tolerate unacceptable behavior. Stand up for your fellow
                Mozillians.  If someone’s words make you feel unsafe or uncomfortable — a
                comment, a joke, a slide — and can’t address it with them directly, consider
                involving an intermediary (like the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Conductors" target="_blank">Conductors</a>,
                for example).</p>
              <p>If you’ve made someone feel unsafe or uncomfortable, be open to adjusting
                your presentation or public speech and apologize directly when needed.</p>
              <h4>Have Fun</h4>
              <p>The Summit is our opportunity to pause and celebrate who we are and all that
                we have accomplished. It’s a chance to meet other amazing humans, to connect,
                to dance, to build things, to break them too.   It’s your moment to dig in
                and have fun.</p>

                    lower voltage, you should not connect it to the Belgian power net unless you have the
                    correct transformer (voltage adaptor). The Belgian power plug is the Western-European
                    type, with two round pin-holes.  Plugs from the UK, North and South America, and Asia
                    will not fit into a Belgian electrical socket.</li>
                  <li>Toronto/Santa Clara - Voltages = 120V, 60 Hz and power plugs = Type A (NEMA 1–15
                    U.S. 2 pin) and Type B (NEMA 5–15 U.S. 3 pin)</li>

                one for you.</p>
              <h4>Tipping</h4>
              <p>

                  <li>Brussels - No tipping in restaurants, it is included already</li>
